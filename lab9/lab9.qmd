## Importing data

```{r}
candy_file <- "candy-data.csv"

candy = read.csv(candy_file, row.names = 1)
head(candy)
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

There are `r nrow(candy)` candy types in this dataset

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

There are `r sum(candy$fruity)` candy types in the dataset

## What is your favorite candy?

```{r}
candy["Twix", ]$winpercent
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it's winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Warheads", ]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for "Kit Kat"?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for "Tootsie Roll Snack Bars"?

It is `r candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent`


```{r}
# install.packages("skimr")
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

Yes, winpercent

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

0 represents FALSE, 1 represents TRUE

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(x = winpercent) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No skews to the left a bit

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

below 50%
```{r}
mean(candy$winpercent)
```
But mean is above 50%

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

```{r}
chocolate <- candy$winpercent[candy$chocolate == 1]
mean(chocolate)
fruity <- candy$winpercent[candy$fruity == 1]
mean(fruity)

```
chocolate candy is ranked higher than fruity candy

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(chocolate, fruity)
```
It is

## Overall candy rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
candy <- dplyr::arrange(candy, winpercent)
head(candy, 5)
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
candy <- dplyr::arrange(candy, desc(winpercent))
head(candy, 5)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(x = winpercent, y = rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
#| fig-height: 12
#| fig-width: 7

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(x = winpercent, y = reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()

# ggsave("barplot.png", height = 12) # if want to save graph as figure
```

`![](barplot.png)` if want to insert an image

### add some colors

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

```{r}
#| fig-height: 12
#| fig-width: 7
ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill = my_cols) 
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets
> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

## Taking a look at pricepercent

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3.3, max.overlaps = 5)
```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

```{r}
candy <- dplyr::arrange(candy, desc(pricepercent))
head( candy[,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```
Hershey's Krackel

## Exploring the correlation structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```
> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and fruity
> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

chocolate and bar

## Principal Component Analysis

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2])
```
```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

```{r}
my_data <- cbind(candy, pca$x[,1:3])
```

```{r}
ggplot(my_data) + 
  aes(x=PC1, y=PC2,
      label=rownames(my_data)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col = my_cols, max.overlaps = 5)
```
For interactive plot:
```{r}
#library(plotly)
```

```{r}
#p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
#        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
#            size=winpercent/100,  
 #           text=rownames(my_data),
#            label=rownames(my_data)) +
#ggplotly(p)
```

```{r}
par(mar=c(8,4,2,2))
barplot(pca$rotation[,1], las=2, ylab="PC1 Contribution")
```
```{r}
res <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)
ggplot(res) +
  aes(PC1, row.names(res)) +
  geom_col()
```
> Q24. What original variables are picked up strongly by PC1 in the positive direction? Do these make sense to you?

pluribus, hard, and fruity
