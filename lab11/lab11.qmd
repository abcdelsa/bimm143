> Q13: Read this file into R and determine the sample size for each genotype and their
corresponding median expression levels for each of these genotypes.

```{r}
df <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
```

```{r}
unique(df$geno)
sum(df$geno == "A/G")
sum(df$geno == "A/A")
sum(df$geno == "G/G")
```

```{r}
median(df[df$geno == "A/G",]$exp)
median(df[df$geno == "A/A",]$exp)
median(df[df$geno == "G/G",]$exp)
```

> Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative
expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the
expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(df, aes(geno, exp, fill = geno)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Genotype", y = "Expression")
```

having G in one of the alleles is associated with low expression of ORMDL3
